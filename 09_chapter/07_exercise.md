## Your Turn

Here's the starter code for your next exercise:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/woriviq/embed?js,console">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

Last time, we wrote code that took an input `x` and set a new `result` value according to a specific set of rules; this time, your challenge is to loop through every number from 1 to `max`, applying those exact same rules to that number and, finally, printing the result out to the console using the command `console.log(result);`.

For reference, if `max` is 20, the following should get displayed in the console:

```javascript
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
17
fizz
19
buzz
```

and testing any number less than 20 should give you a subset of that result - in other words, if `max` is 5, we get the following:

```
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
```
