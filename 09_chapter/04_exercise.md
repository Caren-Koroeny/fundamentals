Take a look at the sample code in the JS Bin below. If you don't see the JS Bin, please refresh the page.

This exercise may be familiar to some of you â€” your job is to write some code that, depending on the value of `x`, assigns one of several values to `result`:

* If `x` is evenly divisible by 3 (for example, 3, 6, or 9), set `result` to "fizz."
* If `x` is evenly divisible by 5 (for example, 5 or 10), set `result` to "buzz."
* If `x` is evenly divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example, 0 or 15), set `result` to "fizzbuzz."
* If `x` is not evenly divisible by either 3 or 5 (for example, 7), set `result` to `x`.

> Don't remember how to determine if something divides evenly? Look back at Unit 3 (Expressions) and review the modulus (`%`) operator.

To test your code, set a value for `x` in the editor and click "Run." Did you get the `result` you expected? Try out several different values for `x`, just to be sure.
