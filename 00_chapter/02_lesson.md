#### Units & Lessons

This ebook has 11 units, each unit contains lessons, [exercises and assignments](00_chapter/03_lesson.md).

Each lesson covers a new topic related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript or developer tools. Lessons are structured with explanations and plenty of examples to help you grasp these new topics. In this interactive book, we'll review HTML and CSS concepts you learned during your admissions assignment ([Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)), and cover some new ground.  

HTML and CSS lessons include *videos!*

Coming Soon!: General Assembly's product team is creating high quality videos for our JavaScript lessons.
