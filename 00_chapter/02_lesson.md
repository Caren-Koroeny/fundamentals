#### Units & Lessons

This ebook has 11 units; each unit contains lessons, [exercises, and assignments](03_lesson.md).

* Every unit has objectives at the beginning. This is where we'll share the most important takeaways.

* Each lesson covers a new topic related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or developer tools. Lessons are structured with explanations and plenty of examples to help you grasp these new topics. In this interactive ebook, we'll review the HTML and CSS concepts you learned during your admissions assignment ([Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)), and also cover some new ground.  

HTML and CSS lessons include *videos!*

Coming Soon! General Assembly's product team is creating high quality videos for our JavaScript lessons.
