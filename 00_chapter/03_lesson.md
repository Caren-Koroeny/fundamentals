**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

---

### Exercises

This ebook is interactive! Within every Unit, we've included practice exercises using a code editor (called JS Bin) that allows you to practice without leaving the page. If you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "Save" button on the top left of the JSBin editor, which will open a new browser.

Here's an example. Click on the tabs to get used to the navigation.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/zojica/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>


Make sure to create a [JSBin account](https://jsbin.com/). Creating a free account will allow you to save your exercises as "bins." You're not required to submit these exercises, but you'll want to save your work in case you have questions and want to review these with your instructors or the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/intro.md).

**Pro Tip**: Remember, the code you write in the JS Bin editor will *not automatically save.* Therefore, you need to make sure that you hit the ***save*** button and make sure you copy your code over.

**Note**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load or shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh the page to load the page again.


### Quizzes

Your instructional team will track your progress using our unit quizzes. After completing each unit, take the unit quiz to check your understanding of the concepts. When completing the quiz, please use the same email address that you provided for your invoice.

If you want to retake the quiz, just refresh the page! Practice makes perfect :+1:

### Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, where you'll code a **web browser based memory game**. You'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the game, unit by unit!

For Units 1-5, you'll need to save the HTML and CSS portions of your unit assignments locally. Starting in Unit 7, you'll learn how Git & Github work, and in Unit 8 you'll begin pushing your source code to Github instead. In the meantime, make sure to save your progress!

**Final Submission**: At the end of the project in Unit 11, you'll submit a link to your Github repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).


### Grading

Your instructor will review your completed assignment on the first day of class.

While most quizzes and assignments won't be formally graded, your WDI instructors will be checking your submissions to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made all the necessary progress before your first week of WDI.

If you have any concerns about your progress, feel free to reach out to your producer or instructor.

### Getting Help

Shhh. Ok, we're going to let you in on a little secret. Ready?

The exercise answers are at the back of the book :) That's right. If you're stuck, we've supplied exercise solutions to help you work backwards and understand what needs to be done.

You can also tune into the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/intro.md) to ask for help or see what other classmates are talking about! We'll set up our Slack accounts in the next lesson.
