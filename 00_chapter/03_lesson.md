**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

---

### Exercises

What makes this book interactive are the exercises! Exercises are how we'll practice the concepts introduced in each Unit. The exercises use a code editor (JS Bin) which allows you to practice right here, in the book. If you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "Save" button on the top left of the JSBin editor which will open a new browser.

Here's an example. Click the tabs to get used to the navigation.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/zojica/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>


Create a [JSBin account](https://jsbin.com/). Creating a free account will allow you to save your exercises as "bins." You're not required to submit the exercises, but be sure to save your work if you have any questions that you want to ask your instructors or the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/intro.md).

**Pro Tip**: What you write in the code editor in this ebook will not automatically save. Therefore, you need to make sure that you hit the *save* button and make sure you copy your code over.

**Note**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load or shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh the page to load the page again.


### Quizzes

Your instructional team will track your progress using the quiz. After completing a unit, take the unit quiz to check your understanding of the concepts. When taking the quiz, use the same email you provided for your invoice.

If you want to retake the quiz, just refresh the page. Practice makes perfect.

### Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, a working **web browser based memory game**. You'll use  HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the game, unit by unit. You'll save your HTML and CSS portions of your unit assignments (Units 1 through 5) locally. In unit 6 you'll start pushing your source code to Github (in Units 7 through 11) once you learn about how Git and Github work. To clarify, you'll only be pushing your project to Github once you get to Chapter 7 where we first introduce JavaScript.

**Final Submission**: At the end of the project in Unit 10, you'll submit your link to your Github repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).


### Grading

Your instructor will review your assignment on the first day of class.

While your quizzes and assignments won't be formally graded, your WDI instructors will be checking your submitted work to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made necessary progress before the first week of WDI. If you have any concerns about your progress, reach out to your producer or instructor to talk to them and get help.

### Getting Help

Shhh. The exercise answers are at the back of the book :) If you're stuck, we've supplied exercise solutions. Also be sure to tune into the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/intro.md) to ask for help or see what others are talking about! We'll set up our Slack accounts in the next lesson.
