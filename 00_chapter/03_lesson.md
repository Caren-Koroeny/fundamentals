**Welcome to WDI Fundamentals**

### JS Bin Exercises

This ebook is interactive! Within every Unit, we've included practice exercises using a code editor (called JS Bin) that allows you to practice without leaving the page.

Here's an example. You can type your code directly into the text editor and also click the various tabs (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) to type in additional code. The OUTPUT tab will render your code in real time.

Click on the tabs to get used to the navigation.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/zojica/embed?html,output&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

>You're not required to submit these exercises, but you'll want to save your work in case you have questions and want to review these with your instructors or the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/intro.md).


#### To Save Your Code

Creating a free account on JS Bin will allow you to save your exercises as "bins." So Make sure to create a [JS Bin account](https://jsbin.com/login). Follow the instructions below to create your JS Bin account and learn how to save your code.

1)  If you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "SAVE" button on the top left of the JS Bin editor, which will open a new browser.

2) Log in using a GitHub account. If you don’t have one go [here](../07_chapter/07_exercise.html) to find instructions set up your account. *As of recently, JS bin only accepts GitHub accounts for registration.*

3) Once logged in, if you try to make your changes in any tab, you’ll receive the following message.

You’ll want to click on the “clone your own copy” which will generate a new link.

4) Now that you're logged in, you can save your code by doing one of the following:

* File > Export as gist. This will save your file as a github repository on your github! Read more about gists [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/)
* File > Download. Download and save your file locally.
* Save your JS bin url. Simply copy and save your JS bin url for future reference. You can also go to File >My Bins to find the bin. Additionally, you can also File > Save Snapshot at point in time where JS bin will automatically save the latest version for you on your working copy.

**Pro Tip**: Remember, the code you write in the JS Bin editor will *not automatically save.* Therefore, you need to make sure that you hit the ***save*** button and make sure you copy your code over.

**Note**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load or shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh the page to load the page again.


### Quizzes

Your instructional team will track your progress using our unit quizzes. After completing each unit, take the unit quiz to check your understanding of the concepts. When completing the quiz, please use the same email address that you provided for your invoice.

If you want to retake the quiz, just refresh the page! Practice makes perfect :+1:

### Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, where you'll code a **web browser based memory game**. You'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the game, unit by unit!

For Units 1-5, you'll need to save the HTML and CSS portions of your unit assignments locally. Starting in Unit 7, you'll learn how Git & GitHub work, and in Unit 8 you'll begin pushing your source code to GitHub instead. In the meantime, make sure to save your progress!

**Final Submission**: At the end of the project in Unit 11, you'll submit a link to your GitHub repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).


### Grading

Your instructor will review your completed assignment on the first day of class.

While most quizzes and assignments won't be formally graded, your WDI instructors will be checking your submissions to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made all the necessary progress before your first week of WDI.

If you have any concerns about your progress, feel free to reach out to your producer or instructor.


### Getting Help

#### Additional Resources

Shhh. Ok, we're going to let you in on a little secret. Ready?

The exercise answers are at the back of the book :) That's right. If you're stuck, we've supplied exercise solutions to help you work backwards and understand what needs to be done.
