#Benefits of Classes

In the last video, we learned that class and ID selectors allow you additional flexibility and control over styling different elements on your page. You also learned the difference between classes and IDs– styling a group of elements (classes) or just one (IDs).

So what’s the recommended approach when adding these selectors to your elements? The best practice when adding specificity to your CSS is to only do so when necessary, and always think about scalability. How do we follow these practices?

## Use Element Selectors
Ask yourself if you can apply the style to the element selector instead of creating a class or ID. If so, use the element selector to style your elements.

## Use IDs Sparingly
 Truly unique elements on the page are rare– so use classes instead. This helps with scalability because it will allow you to use the style for another element. You'll typically find the styles that you're putting in an ID can come in handy in another section of your current page, or even another page on your website. 


Let's take a look at an example.
