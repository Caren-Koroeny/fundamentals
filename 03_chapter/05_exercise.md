Time to give it a whirl! In this exercise you'll be getting some practice opening and closing your first HTML tags, and learn how they relate to the content on your website.

### Instructions

Use the editor provided below to write your code below and see what it renders! Follow the steps below.

1 . Let's start with some content! Type what you see to the right into the HTML box down below.

```
My first website!
by a talented student
Built with WDI at GA.
```

2 .  Go ahead and open a *level one heading tag* at the very beginning where it says "My first website!"

Note: You'll notice that everything was set to h1! However, you still need to close the tag to tell the browser where to stop rendering as a heading.

3 . Go ahead and close the heading tag.

4 . Open and close *second-level heading* on the second line "by a talented student."

5 . And lastly, wrap the sentence "Built with WDI at GA." in a paragraph tag.
