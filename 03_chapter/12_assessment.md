# Create Cards and Check for Equality

Now that we have covered variables and booleans, we can write code that simulates the cards in our game as well as compare them for a match.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Create four variables that simulate the cards in your game
    - they should be `String` types
    - two should have a value of `"queen"` and the other two should be `"king"`
    - name your variables `cardOne`, `cardTwo`, etc.
- Check to see if your two queen variables are equal to one another
- Check to see if one of your king variables and one of your queen variables are equal to one another

#### Below are the steps to complete the assignment.

1) Create four cards

```js
var cardOne = "queen";

var cardTwo = "queen";

var cardThree = "king";

var cardFour = "king";
```

2) Compare two queen variables

```js
cardOne == cardTwo
```

3) Compare a king variable with a queen variable

```js
cardOne == cardFour
```

#### Deliverable

When complete, you should have something that looks like this:
