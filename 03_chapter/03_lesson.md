#Classes and IDs

Classes and IDs, also called **selectors**, are ways of targeting the style of specific HTML elements on your page.

So what’s the difference between them? In short, classes allow you to style many elements with a particular style, while IDs are only capable of styling a single element. Using these selectors allows you flexibility and control of styling individual, as well as groups, of elements on your page.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/ugwfg1gtqw?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

#Benefits of Classes

In the last video, we learned that class and ID selectors allow you additional flexibility and control over styling different elements on your page. You also learned the difference between classes and IDs– styling a group of elements (classes) or just one (IDs).

So what’s the recommended approach when adding these selectors to your elements? The best practice when adding specificity to your CSS is to only do so when necessary, and always think about scalability. How do we follow these practices?

## Use Element Selectors
Ask yourself if you can apply the style to the element selector instead of creating a class or ID. If so, use the element selector to style your elements.

## Don't Use ID's
Although ID's are technically allowed, they are almost never used by professional developers– so use classes instead. You'll typically find the styles you're applying to an element can come in handy in another section of your current page, or even another page on your website. Using classes will help with the scalability of your design.
