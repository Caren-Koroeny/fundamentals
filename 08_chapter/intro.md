**WDI Fundamentals Unit 8**

##### By the end of this Unit, you'll be able to:
* Practice programmatic thinking by writing pseudo-code.
* Perform arithmetic and logical operations on data to produce new values.
* Concatenate two strings together in JavaScript.
* Write expressions that both assign and evaluate variables.
* Explain what Null is and (generally) how it works.
* Recognize the difference between 'truth-y' and 'false-y' values.

# JavaScript

Now it's time for us to move on to the main event: programming. It is time to add some functionality to our memory game! It's worth mentioning that although most people think of programming as being about writing code, it's really much more about solving problems. Problems such as:

- "How many students are here today?"
- "How far away am I from the restaurant?"
- "What's the fastest way to find the file I'm looking for?"

Trying to "just start coding", without first figuring out the problem at hand is a surefire way to waste time, frustrate yourself, and create sub-optimal products. However, in order to understand how to solve a problem, you first need to understand the tools at your disposal.

In the rest of this chapter, we'll be exploring some of the more common tools and concepts a programmer needs to understand. Although we will be specifically looking at these concepts in the context of **JavaScript**, these tools (or similar ones) are present in nearly every modern programming language. Having a strong understanding of these basics is incredibly important, and will translate to your work in other languages, whether you end up working in JavaScript, Ruby, Python, or any other language.

## JS Bin
To start playing around with JavaScript, we'll be using a website called **[JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/)**.

As you can see in the screenshot above, JSBin features different window panes. On the right, with the light background, is the *preview* - this tool will display what your code builds in real time for you. It automatically updates on any change, unless you uncheck the "Auto-run JS" option in the upper right-hand corner of the *preview* section. On the left, with the dark background, is the *editor*. The editor allows us to write several instructions for our computer using HTML, CSS, and Javascript; to execute these instructions, click the 'Run with JS' button in the right window.

To save your JS Bin session, just 'Login' or 'Register' at the top, and log in with GitHub. When you select 'File' and then 'New' you will be provided a blank space to work in. The moment you begin writing code, JS Bin will generate a URL that you can bookmark and come back to any time you want.

JS Bin has the ability to show a 'console'; this will display any JavaScript code that you need to run. You will need this from time to time. You can hide or display any tabs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Console) by clicking on their tab to hide/show them as needed.
