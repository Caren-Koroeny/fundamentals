Check out the sample code in the JS Bin session below. If you don't see the JS Bin, please refresh the page.

```javascript
/* Your Expression Here */
```

This item above is called a *comment* â€” it tells a computer to completely ignore everything between the two `/` characters. There are two kinds of comments: **multi-line** comments (`/* comment */`), which can run across multiple lines, and **single-line** comments (`// comment`), which only comment out everything following it on the current line.

1) In the console tab (on the right), write an expression that evaluates to the integer `30`, then hit `enter` or `return`.
You can use any expression you like, but it must contain at least one operation (ideally, you'll use two or more). 

	** Note:** Ensure the *type* of this result is correct - Remember `30` and <code>'30'</code> are not the same!

2) Now, replace your first expression with a second expression. This one should evaluate to 'Hello World'.

3) Finally, replace the previous expression with an expression that evaluates to the Boolean `true`. Try using two or three operations for this one!
