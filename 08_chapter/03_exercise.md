Now it's your turn to practice writing pseudocode!

#### Program: Are You Eligible for a Discount?

We'd like to create a program that checks to see whether or not movie patrons are eligible for a discount and then displays the appropriate ticket price.

Here is the pricing structure:

1. Patron are 65 or older, they are eligible for senior discounts. The ticket price for seniors is $6.00.

2. Patrons are 25 or younger, they are eligible for student discounts. The ticket price for students is $8.00.

3. All other tickets cost $10.00.

Try your hand at writing pseudocode for this program. Remember, the goal is to think through the problem and break it down into simple steps.
