Now things are starting to heat up! Let's take a short break from our contact book to practice iterating over arrays.

## Instructions

1) Write the code to perform the actions listed below using JS Bin editor. If you don't see the JS Bin, please refresh the page.
2) Click "Run" to run the code in the "Console" panel.
3) Call each function from the "Console" panel. Try using different parameters to make sure they're working properly.

### Let's get started!

#### Part 1

1) Create an array, `cups`, containing the numbers 1 - 10.
2) Create an empty array, `ounces`.
3) Write a function, `convertToOunces`. It should iterate through the `cups` array, convert each item from cups to ounces, and then add that item to the `ounces` array. Return the value of `ounces` after looping through the items and before the function ends.

#### Part 2

1) Create an array, `scores`, containing the numbers 83, 40, 55, 72, 59, 88, and 99.
2) Write a function, `passOrFail`. It should loop through the `scores` array and replace the current item with `'pass'` if the score is greater than or equal to 60 and `'fail'` if the score is less than 60. Return the `scores` array.
