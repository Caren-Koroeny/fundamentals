##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Let's revisit our "FizzBuzz" activity from Unit 4, incorporating what we've learned so far about writing functions.

Your job this time will be to write a function called `fizzbuzz` that takes a parameter, `num`. For every number from 1 to `num`, this function should print (using `console.log()`) one of the following values:

* `fizz`, if the number is divisible by 3 (but not 5).
* `buzz`, if the number is divisible by 5 (but not 3).
* `fizzbuzz`, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
* The number itself, if it isn't divisible by either 3 or 5.

For reference, running `fizzbuzz(15)` should result in the following text being printed in the console:

```javascript
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
fizz
7
8
fizz
buzz
11
fizz
13
14
fizzbuzz
```

Once again, there's no starter code for this exercise â€” just use the [JS Bin](https://jsbin.com) below. If you don't see the JS Bin, please refresh the page. Feel free to solve this problem any way you like, but consider the guidelines mentioned in the previous unit!

Test your code for several different input values. What do you get if `num` is 1? 10? 30?

If you're satisfied that your code is working as expected, go ahead and move on.
