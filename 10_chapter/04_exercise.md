If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

This time around, you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll need to write some functions from scratch, based on the descriptions given below using JSBin's editor.

###Instructions

1. Write the code for the functions described below, using JSBin's JavaScript tab.
2. Click 'Run' to run the code.
3. Try *calling* each function from the Console tab. If you do not see the Console tab, click the "Console" button at the top of the JSBin window.  Use different parameters to make sure they work as expected.

**Let's get started!**

Write the following functions:
* `sayHello`, which accepts one parameter, called `name`; it should return a greeting to a person with that name, i.e. "Hello, *name*".
* `areBothEven`, which accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`; it should return `true` if `a` and `b` are both even, but `false` otherwise.
* `hotOrNot`, which accepts one parameter, `temp`; it should return "hot" if `temp` is above 75, but should return "not hot" otherwise.
* `threeIfNull`, which accepts one parameter,`num`. If num is `null`, it should return 3, but otherwise, it should return the value of `num`.
* `greatest`, which accepts three parameters (`x`, `y`, and `z`), and returns the one with the greatest value. For example, `greatest(5, 10, 1)` would evaluate to 10.

Once you've written and tested all of these functions, go ahead and move on to the next lesson.
