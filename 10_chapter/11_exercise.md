Let's get some practice manipulating the DOM and adding some interactions to our reading list.

###Instructions

1. Let's get started! Some starter code has been provided in jsfiddle for this exercise.
2. Write the code to perform the actions listed below in the 'js' panel.
3. Click 'run' to see the results in the 'result' panel.

**Let's get started!**

* We've finished reading *The Wind Up Bir Chronicle* and *A Visit From the Goon Squad*! Use the `getElementsByClassName()` to find all elements that have the `current` class. Then use a for loop to iterate through these elements and change the class name to `finished`.

* Now onto our next book on the reading list, *The Flamethrowers*. Use the `getElementById()` method to find that list item. Update the class name to `current`. Then use the `removeAttribute()` method to remove the id attribute.

* Now find the fourth list item and update the id attribute to `next` using the `setAttribute()` method.

* When the user clicks on the button with the id `chill`, loop through all list items and add the class `cool` to each item. Test it out! Each list item should have a blue border after the user clicks on the button.

* When the user clicks on the first list item, add an item to the end of the list that says 'JavaScript is Fun!'
