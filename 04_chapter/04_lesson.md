#Working with Images

HTML and Images

When you’d like to add images to your site, you should use the tag with the “src” attribute. “src” stands for “Source” and works just like the tag’s “href” attribute. It tells the image tag where to find the image you’d want to include on your page.


<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/kn8gfpd9z9?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

>Note: Relative vs. Absolute Addressing
Relative addressing basically tells your browser: “Look in our project folder for the file specified. Or, if a folder is specified, look within that folder for the file specified.”
On the other hand, when we link to a source outside of our project, it is referred to as an absolute address.
