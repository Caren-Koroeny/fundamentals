In this exercise we'll take some time to play around with **divs**, **spans**, **margin**, and **padding** to create a lovely text layout.

Here's what the content will look like when you're finished styling it. Fancy!

If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

We won't touch the HTML, but take a look at it before you hop over to the CSS tab. To give yourself more space you can select the CSS and Output tabs. Also, we gave you the p style. You're welcome!

1 . Set the body's background to #333 and the div's background to #c0dec5.

2 . Add a margin of 4em on *all four sides* of the div's content (outside of the pale blue box).

3 . Set the div's top padding of 2em, a right padding of 3em, no padding on the bottom, and 3em on the left.

4 .Give the span three property-value pairs: a font-variant of small-caps, a font-family of tahoma, sans-serif and .25em of letter-spacing.

5 . Set the span's padding to 0 .2em. Set its background color to rgb(100,150,150).

6 . Actually, that color is a little dark. Let's practice with rgb and alpha, and make it 50% translucent. Change the span's background color from rgb to rgba and add a .5 alpha.

7 . In your HTML, the second p tag has a class attribute named "right" Let's right-align that paragraph! Add the new style to your CSS.


Fabulous! You just rocked on a bunch of topics that can stump even professional web designers.
