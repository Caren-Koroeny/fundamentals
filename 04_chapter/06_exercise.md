Time to give it a whirl! So far, you've worked with named colors, like black, red, or white.But those are only a fraction of the colors that your screen can display. Let's practice matching colors across the three web color models: named colors, hex codes, and RGB colors.


#### HTML: Starter Code
Let's look at the starter HTML: The DOCTYPE, html, head, link, and body elements are familiar.

Divs and ids are new HTML concepts for you. The value of the id attribute is the name of that div.

The div element is just a tool to group content into boxes that you can control and style with CSS. The attribute id lets you name an HTML element to style it differently than other elements of that type.

#### CSS: Starter Code
Let's look at the starter CSS. Click on the CSS tab on the editor. This div style sets the size, position, style, and whitespace on all three boxes.

>Note: **Named Colors** - Like black and white. There's a pretty limited number of these.

### Instructions

1 . Change the value of the #name div from white to red.

2 . Turn the hex div red by leaving the first two characters at their maximums of ff, and changing the last four characters to their minimums of zero.

3 . Turn the rgb div red by leaving the red value at its maximum of 255, and changing both the green and blue values to their minimums of 0.

4 . What color do you think you'd get if you set all the RGB values to their minimum of zero? Can you set all three boxes to that color? Set all the numbers in the rgb color model to zero. Set all six characters in the hex div to zero. Then, use a named color to make all three boxes the same color.

5 . **Bonus**: Add an alpha value to the RGB model.

Now Change the #rgb style to: background: rgba(0,0,0,1); Since the default opacity is 100%, this won't change anything on screen. But now you have a means to set the opacity.

Bravo to you on utterly mastering color models for the web. Take this knowledge forward and make the internet a more colorful space!
