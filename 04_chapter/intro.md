#Intro to CSS

So whatâ€™s the difference between HTML and CSS? And when do I use each?

As we mentioned in the earlier unit, HTML, or **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage, is the standard language used to code web pages. All of the content on a website is added with HTML. CSS or **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets, decides how the content written in an HTML document looks, such as the layout, colors, and fonts.

In this unit, we'll learn more about CSS and styling to create better designed websites!

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/32r0wluyl3?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
