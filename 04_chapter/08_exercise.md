### ELK Web Design: Part 1

In this exercise, you'll learn the basics of laying out a webpage while building a small business website for ELK Web Design! The final design is based on an assignment submitted by a FEWD graduate, Lauren Kathe, and looks like this:

This design has four sections:

* Header
* "About" section
* "Services" section
* Footer

If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

This exercise has two sections. First, we'll create the structure of the website. Then, we'll add CSS. 

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/guviweg/embed?html&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

#### Section 1: Basic Page Structure
Your job is to use the notes below to write the HTML for ELK Web Design.

1) **The Header**
  * ELK Web Design has a header element inside the body which contains the company name, **ELK Web Design**, as a level 1 heading, or `h1`.

  * The header also contains this image: http://i.imgur.com/pdsjjxD.jpg

2) **The Body**
  * Inside the body there are two sections (or "divs"). One section is for the "About" content, the other for "Services". The section headings are level 2, or `h2`.

  * _About Content_:

    "ELK provides clean and innovative sites for small businesses, artists, and professionals."

  * _Service Content_:

    "HTML, CSS, Responsive, Visual Design."

3) **The Footer**
  
  * _Footer Content_:

    "&copy; 2014 ELK"

#### Section 2: Styling Text

Flip on over to your CSS tab.

1) Create a style for the body, and set its font-size to 18px. Set the font-family to Arial.

2) Write another rule for h1, and set its font-size to 2em.

3) Create a style rule for h2, and set its font-size to 1.5em.

4) Use only one padding declaration to give h2 a top and bottom padding of .8em.

5) Create a rule for both h1, h2.

6) Set its text-transform property to uppercase.

7) Let's keep styling both headings. We'll use CSS shorthand to "underline" each one with a `border-bottom`. Give h1, h2 a border-bottom property that's 4px thick, solid, and black.

8) Set h1, h2's display to inline-block.

9) Create a style for images, and set its display to block.

10) Center all images on the page horizontally by setting img's margin to 0 auto.

11) Create a ul style, and set its list-style to none.

12) Set its margin to 0. and its padding to 0.

13) Create a footer style in your CSS, and center align its text.

14) Set the footer's padding to 1em 0.

Here's what your webpage should look like in the Output now:

All done for now!

*In the next Code Challenge, you'll be ready to build a navigation bar, experiment with web fonts, and use CSS to resize the hero imageâ€”plus. You'll also position all of the content containers you built in this unit!*
