### Elk Web Design: Part 1

In this exercise, you'll learn the basics of laying out a webpage while building a small business website for ELK Design! The final design is based on an assignment submitted by a FEWD graduate, Lauren Kathe, and looks like this:

This design has four sections:

* header
* "about" section
* "services" section
* footer

If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

This exercise has two sections. In the first, we'll create the structure of the website, and for the second section we're going to add CSS. 

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="https://jsbin.com/nideji/embed?html&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

#### Section 1: Basic Page structure
Your job is to use the notes below to write the HTML for the Elk Design Company.

1 . **The Header**
  * Elk Design has a header element inside the body which contains the company name **ELK Web Design** as a level 1 heading.

  * The header also contains this image: http://i.imgur.com/pdsjjxD.jpg

2 . **The Body**
  * Inside the body there are two sections (hint: divs). One section is for the "about" content, the other is for "services". The section headings are level 2.

  * The body also contains a footer.

  * _About Content_ :

    Elk provides clean and innovative sites for small businesses, artists, and professionals.

  * _Service Content_

    HTML, CSS, Responsive, Visual Design.

  * _Footer Content_

#### Section 2: Styling text

Flip on over to your CSS tab.

1 . Create a style for body, and set its font-size to 18px. Set the font-family to Arial.

2 . Write another rule for h1, and set its font-size to 2em.

3 . Create a style rule for h2, and set its font-size to 1.5em.

4 . Use only one padding declaration to give h2 a top and bottom padding of .8em.

5 . Create a rule for both h1, h2.

6 . Set its text-transform property to uppercase.

7 . Let's keep styling both headings. We'll use CSS shorthand to "underline" each one with a `border-bottom`. Give h1, h2 a border-bottom property that's 4px thick, solid, and black.

8 . Set h1, h2's display to inline-block.

9 . Create a style for images, and set its display to block.

10 . Center all images on the page horizontally by setting img's margin to 0 auto.

11 . Create a ul style, and set its list-style to none.

12 . Set its margin to 0. and its padding 0.

13 . Create a footer style in your CSS, and center align its text.

14 . Set the footer's padding to 1em 0.

Here's what your webpage should look like in the Output now:

All done for now!

*In the next Code Challenge, you're ready to build a navigation bar, experiment with web fonts, and use CSS to resize the hero imageâ€”plus, you'll position all of the content containers you built in this unit!*
