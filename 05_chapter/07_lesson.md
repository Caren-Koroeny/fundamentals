# Column Layout

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/fk9027biok?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

## Reminder: Don't Use ID's
Although ID's are technically allowed, they are almost never used by professional developersâ€“ so use classes instead. You'll typically find the styles you're applying to an element can come in handy in another section of your current page, or even another page on your website. Using classes will help with the scalability of your design.

#### Checkpoint

* What does the `<aside>` tag do?
* How would you go about creating three columns on your webpage?
