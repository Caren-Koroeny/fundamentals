## Reminder: Don't Use IDs in CSS

You are technically allowed to use CSS ID selectors, but these are almost never used by professional developers because of their specificity. CSS classes give you the ability to reuse styles, and any style specified with an ID isn't reusable. Also, ID selectors can override class selectors, making a codebase more difficult to maintain when it gets larger.

Overall, using class selectors in your CSS will help with the scalability of your design, and help you write cleaner code.


## Reminder: Using IDs in JavaScript

When writing JavaScript, IDs are valuable to help you access and alter different elements on your page. This process is called DOM Manipulation. You'll learn more about manipulating the DOM once we dive deeper into JavaScript, but remember, when writing CSS, style and select using classes!
