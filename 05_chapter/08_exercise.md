In this exercise, you'll learn the basics of laying out a webpage while building a small business website for ELK Design! The final design is based on a project by FEWD graduate, Lauren Kathe, and looks like this:

The design has four sections that we'll add in:

* header
* "about" section
* "services" section
* footer

Don't worry yet about positioning them on the page yet. For this exercise, we're just going to put them in! You'll be using the code editor below. As usual, **don't forget to fork and save your JSBin link.** You'll be reusing the code to continue building on the exercise in the next unit.

#### Part 1: Basic Page structure

**HTML Starter Code**: What's waiting for you in the HTML tab is familiar: it's your boilerplate! Nothing in the head shows up on screen. So let's move into the body, where you can see things happening!

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/nideji/embed?html&height=600px"> on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

1 . Open and close a header element inside the body.

2 . Write **ELK Web Design** inside the header.

3 . Below the `h1`, add an image tag that links to this URL - http://i.imgur.com/pdsjjxD.jpg

4 . Inside the body and below the header element, open and close two empty divs.

5 . Then, open and close one set of footer tags underneath.

6 . Give the first empty div an id of "about"

8 . Give the second empty div an id of "services"

9 . Write `<h2>`Who we are`</h2>` inside the "about" section.

10 . Put a paragraph under the heading. It can be "about" anything you want or what's below!

*Elk provides clean and innovative sites for small businesses, artists, and professionals.*

11 . Write `<h2>`How we do it`</h2>` inside the "services" div.

13 . Below that, open and close an empty unordered list.

14 . Put the four list items inside your unordered list. Again, don't worry if it doesn't look like the target layout yet.

15 . Write &copy; 2014 ELK between the opening and closing footer tags.

#### Part 2: Styling text

Flip on over to your CSS tab.

1 . Create a style for body, and set its font-size to 18px.

2 . Write another rule for h1, and set its font-size to 2em.

3 . Create a style rule for h2, and set its font-size to 1.5em.

4 . Use only one padding declaration to give h2 a top and bottom padding of .8em.

5 . Create a rule for both h1, h2.

6 . Set its text-transform property to uppercase.

7 . Let's keep styling both headings. We'll use CSS shorthand to "underline" each one with a `bottom-border`.Give h1, h2 a border-bottom property that's 4px thick, solid, and black.

8 . Set h1, h2's display to inline-block.

9 . Create a style for images, and set its display to block.

10 . Center all images on the page horizontally by setting img's margin to 0 auto.

11 . Create a ul style, and set its list-style to none.

12 . Set its margin to 0. and its padding 0.

13 . Create a footer style in your CSS, and center align its text.

14 . Set the footer's padding to 1em 0.

Here's what your webpage should look like in the Output now:

All done for now!

*In the next Code Challenge, you're ready to build a navigation bar, experiment with web fonts, and use CSS to resize the hero imageâ€”plus, you'll position all of the content containers you built in this unit!*
