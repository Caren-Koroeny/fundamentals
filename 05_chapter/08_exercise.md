Learn the basics of laying out a webpage while building a small business website for ELK Design!

The final design is based on a project by FEWD graduate, Lauren Kathe, and looks like this.

The design has four sections that we'll add in:

* header
* "about" section
* "services" section
* footer

Don't worry yet about positioning them on the page. For this Code Challenge, we're just going to put them in! Use the code editor below.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/dulivo/embed?html&height=600px">ELK Web Design on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.12"></script>

#### Basic Page structure

What's waiting for you in the HTML tab is familiar: it's your boilerplate!

1 . Nothing in the head shows up on screen. So let's move into the body, where you can see things happening!
2 . Open and close a header element inside the body.
3 . Write `<h1>`ELK Web Design</h1> inside the header.
4 . Below the `h1`, add an image tag that links to this URL: http://i.imgur.com/pdsjjxD.jpg
5 . Inside the body and below the header element, open and close two empty divs.
6 . Then, open and close one set of footer tags underneath.
7 . Give the first empty div an id of "about"
8 . Give the second empty div an id of "services"
9 . Put content into the divs and the footer, so we can start styling the page!
10 . Write `<h2>`Who we are`</h2>` inside the "about" section.
11 . Put a paragraph under the heading. It can be "about" anything you want!
12 . Write `<h2>`How we do it`</h2>` inside the "services" div.
13 . Below that, open and close an empty unordered list.
14 . Put the four list items inside your unordered list. Again, don't worry if it doesn't look like the target layout yet.
15 . Write &copy; 2014 ELK between the opening and closing footer tags.

#### Styling text

Flip on over to your CSS tab.

1 .Create a style for body, and set its font-size to 18px.
2 .Write another rule for h1, and set its font-size to 2em.
3 .Create a style rule for h2, and set its font-size to 1.5em.
4 .Use only one padding declaration to give h2 a top and bottom padding of .8em.
5 .Create a rule for h1, h2.
6 .Set its text-transform property to uppercase.
7 .Let's keep styling both headings. We'll use CSS shorthand to "underline" each one with a `bottom-border`.Give h1, h2 a border-bottom property that's 4px thick, solid, and black.
8 .Set h1, h2's display to inline-block.
9 .Create a style for images, and set its display to block.
10 .Center all images on the page horizontally by setting img's margin to 0 auto.
11 . Create a ul style, and set its list-style to none.
12 .Set its margin to 0. and its padding 0.
13 .Create a footer style in your CSS, and center align its text.
14 .Set the footer's padding to 1em 0.

*In the next Code Challenge, you're going to build a navigation bar, experiment with web fonts, and use CSS to resize the hero image—plus, you'll position all of the content containers you built in this unit.*s
