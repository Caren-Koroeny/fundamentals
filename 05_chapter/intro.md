Often times a **sitemap** or **user flow** illustrates the primary and alternate paths you intend your user to take through the site, based upon user goals.

In order to make this user flow come to life, we're going to need to build out a **navigation bar**. The navigation bar is a section on a website that links to other parts of the site. You'll use the `<nav></nav>` elements to define a set of navigation links. You can also make your navigation appear vertically, horizontally or alternatively-styled bloc.

Before we get started, look at the code to get familiar with how you'd code in a nav bar on your site!
