> **NOTE** Moving forward we'll be labeling html tags and relevant code in the `following format`. Ex. `p` for a paragraph tag or element.

##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Time to give it a whirl! In this exercise you'll be getting some practice opening and closing your first HTML tags.

Your output should look like this:

### Instructions
If you don't see the JS Bin below, please refresh the page.

Type your answers directly into the text editor below. Click the **Output** button at the top of the editor to see how your html code renders.

1 . Let's start with some content! Type the text below into your editor.

```
My first website!
by a talented student
Built with WDI at GA.
```

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/xuhubej/embed?html&height=600px">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.37.0"></script>

2 . Go ahead and open a *level one heading tag* (`h1`) at the very beginning where it says "My first website!"

3 . Did you notice that everything was set to `h1` when you opened the level one heading tag? Ah ha! You still need to close the tag, which tells the browser when to stop rendering as a heading. Go ahead and close the heading tag now.

4 . Open and close *second-level heading* (`h2`) on the second line "by a talented student."

5 . Last, wrap the sentence "Built with WDI at GA." in a paragraph tag (`p`).

#### Checkpoint

Make sure you have:
- Opened and closed `h1` tags around the site's name.
- Opened and closed `h2` tags around the site's subheading.
- Opened and closed `p` tags around the site's body content.


Sweet! You just built a website with HTML. Ok sure, it's pretty basic, but you're just getting started!!
