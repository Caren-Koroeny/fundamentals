#Working with Images

Your website can really come to life with a couple images! When you’d like to add images to your site, you should use the tag with the **src** attribute. `src` stands for “Source” and works just like the tag’s `href` attribute. It tells the image tag where to find the image you’d want to include on your page. Learn how to add images
