# Introduction to HTML

In this unit we've already introduced some of the core fundamentals of web development, including how the internet works as well as how websites are structured and styled.

With our newfound knowledge, we can go ahead and create the foundation of our memory card game app. The goal of this exercise is to build the primary structure of the website that will host our memory card game.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

* Personalize your website by displaying the name of the game in a corresponding browser tab and include the name of your game as a header.
* What good is a game if you don't know how to play? Under your header, include a subheader called "Instructions," and add a section explaining how the memory card game is played.

##### Below are the steps to complete the assignment.

1) Open up Sublime Text Editor.

2) Create a new file called `index.html`

3) Set up the your HTML boilerplate code.

4) Add a `title` element so the name of the game shows in the browser tab.

5) Create level one heading tags (`h1`) and add in the name of the game within those tags. In this case, the you can just title it: "Memory Game."

6) Add in a level two heading tag (`h2`) that says "Instructions."

7) Type in the text below your level two heading tag in between paragraph tags.

*Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.*

8) Great! In order to preview your page, double-click your `index.html` file to open it in the browser. If you want to make changes to your page and view those updates in the browser, simply make sure your file is saved before refreshing the page in the browser.

#### Bonus

* Add a subheading describing your game. What is fun about it? Why is it awesome?

* Include a few personal social media links, so your users can learn about the developer behind the game - you!

* Throw some paint on your canvas! Try adding some flare to your site by using the CSS property `color` to spice up your headers. First, add the color *teal* to your h1 tag.

* Second, add the color *gold* to your `h2` tags.

>**NOTE** To add styling within your HTML file, write your CSS between the `<style></style>` tags.
