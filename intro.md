Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!

We hope you find WDI to be as rewarding as it is challenging â€” we can assure you it will be both. There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn before starting WDI and being unprepared can easily trip you up. To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming.

We'll cover **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. In addition we'll learn how to work on the command line as well as use **Git** and **Github** to host our files. These concepts will come up throughout the course, and becoming familiar with them before the course begins will help set you up for success.

The entire ebook is eleven units long and we expect it to take you around **40 hours to complete** it. Make sure you read below before continuing as we've outlined some important things to keep in mind as you move through Fundamentals!

#### Lessons

Each lesson covers a new topic related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript or developer tools. Lessons are structured with explanations and plenty of examples to help you grasp these new topics. If you've taken [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) before, you might be familiar with a bit of the HTML and CSS. We'll go a bit more in depth with HTML and CSS. We've provided *videos* for these lessons. You'll notice that when we get to Git, Github and JavaScript, we have more "text" heavy lessons. We hope to be able to provide you with videos for these lessons in the near future to help support your learning!

#### Exercises

We've also included exercises to make sure you're able to practice the concepts introduced in each Unit. The exercises have a built in code editor (JSBin) where you can directly type in your code. However if you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "Save" button in the top left of the JSBin editor which will open a new browser.

You'll also want to create an account on JSBin. On the top right, you'll see a "Login or Register" button. Click on it to create your account. That way you can save all your exercises as "bins."

**Note**: What you write in the code editor in this e-book will not automatically save. Therefore, you need to make sure that you do hit the *save* button and make sure you copy your code over manually.

**Hint**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load and shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh your page to load the editor again.

You're not required to submit the exercises, but be sure to save your work if you have any questions that you want to ask your instructors or the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/get_started.md).

#### Quizzes

Make sure you complete the quizzes to check for your understanding of the concepts covered in each Unit. You'll have to enter in your email and GA location in order for the quiz to get processed. Quizzes also ensure that our team here that you're making sufficient progress towards finishing Fundamentals before WDI.

#### Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, a working **web browser based memory game**. You'll incorporate your HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge to build this game, piece by piece. You'll save your HTML and CSS portions of your unit assignments (Units 1 through 4) locally and then move to pushing your project code on Github (in Units 7 through 11) once you learn about how Git and Github work. To clarify, you'll only be pushing your project to Github once you get to Chapter 7 where we first introduce JavaScript.

**Final Submission**: At the end of the project in Unit 10, you'll submit your link to your Github repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).

### Grading

While your quizzes and project won't be formally graded, your WDI instructors will be checking your submitted work to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made necessary progress before the first week of WDI. If you have any concerns about your progress, reach out to your producer or instructor to talk to them and get help.

### Getting Help
If you're stuck, we've supplied exercises solutions at the very end of the e-book to ensure you're able to move through swiftly! Also be sure to tune into the WDI community on [Slack](00_chapter/get_started.md) to ask for help or see what others are talking about! We'll set up our Slack accounts in the next lesson.
