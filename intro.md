Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive Remote (WDIr) program at General Assembly!

Whether you're enrolled to attend classes remotely (WDIr) or on campus, we hope you find WDI to be as rewarding as it is challenging â€” we can assure you it will be both! There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn before starting WDI and being unprepared can easily trip you up. To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming.

We'll cover **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**.  We'll also learn how to work with standard developer tools (Text Editors, Browsers, the command line, Git, and GitHub).

The entire ebook is eleven units long, and we expect it to take you around **40 hours to complete** it. Make sure you read below before continuing as we've outlined some important things to keep in mind as you move through WDI Fundamentals!


## Join the WDI Community on Slack!

We design our immersive courses to help you embrace the challenge of lifelong learning. This means that when you get stuck, the instructors you work with will often help you to drive your own process of discovery, rather than just give you the right answer. You'll also learn to rely on your classmates for support and structure.

You're probably completing the pre-course work at home or in a coffee shop, and so you won't have the same level of guidance you'll get once you join us on campus. For now, we encourage you to connect with your classmates via Slack, a real time messaging application you'll be using in class.

### Sign onto Slack!
