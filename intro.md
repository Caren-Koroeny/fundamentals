Dear WDI Student,

Congratulations on joining the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly!

We hope you find WDI to be as rewarding as it is challenging â€” we can assure you it will be both. There are a lot of technical ideas to cover and terms to learn, and being unprepared can easily trip you up.

To make sure you have the proper footing, we've prepared this ebook covering the fundamentals of web-based programming. We'll be covering **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. In addition we'll learn how to work on the command line, use **Git** and **Github** to host our files. These concepts will come up throughout the course, and becoming familiar with them before the course begins will help set you up for success.

**The entire ebook is six units long and we expect it to take you around 40 hours to complete it.**

#### Lessons

Each lesson covers a new topic related to HTML, CSS, JavaScript or programming fundamentals and tools. Lessons are structured with explanations and plenty of examples to help you grasp the new topics. If you've taken [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) before, you might be familiar with a bit of the HTML and CSS. We provide videos to cover even more concepts in this e-book. You'll notice that when we get to Git, Github and JavaScript, we have more "text" heavy lessons. We hope to have wonderful videos up soon, but for now, you'll have to read through the lessons.  

#### Exercises

We've also included exercises to make sure you've got a good understanding of the concepts introduced in each Unit. The exercises have a built in code editor (JSBin) where you can directly type in your code. However if you want to save your code, you'll need to hit the "Save" button in the top left of the editor which will open a new browser.

You'll also want to create an account on JSBin. On the top right, you'll see a "Login or Register" button. Click on it to create your account. That way you can save all your exercises as "bins."

*Note*: What you write in the code editor in this e-book will not automatically save. Therefore, you need to make sure that when you do hit the *save* button and still make sure you copy your code over manually.

**Hint**: If your JS Bin editor doesn't load and shows `JS Bin on jsbin.com`, simply refresh your page to load the editor again. 

You're not required to submit the exercises, but be sure to save your work if you have any questions that you want to ask your instructors or the WDI community on (Slack)[00_chapter/get_started.md].

#### Quizzes

Quizzes in Fundamentals will check for your understanding of the concepts covered in each Unit. You'll have to enter in your email and GA location in order for the quiz to get processed. Quizzes ensure our team here that you're making sufficient progress towards finishing Fundamentals before WDI.

#### Final Project

Each unit assignment will build towards your final project, a working browser based memory game. You'll incorporate your html, css and JavaScript knowledge to build this game, piece by piece. You'll save your html and css unit projects locally and then move to pushing your project code on Github once you learn about how Git and Github work. To clarify, when you get to Chapter 7 where we first introduce JavaScript, you'll be pushing your project code to Github.

At the end of the project in Unit 10, you'll submit your link to your Github repository via [this form](https://ga-immersives.typeform.com/to/UHC5Yp).

### Grading

While your quizzes and project won't be formally graded, your WDI instructors will be checking your submitted work to make sure you've completed Fundamentals and made necessary progress before the first week of WDI. If you have any concerns about your progress, reach out to your producer or instructor to talk to them and get help.

### Getting Help
If you're stuck, we've supplied exercises solutions at the very end of the e-book to ensure you're able to move through swiftly! Also be sure to tune into the WDI community on (Slack)[00_chapter/get_started.md] to ask for help or see what others are talking about! We'll set up our Slack accounts in the next lesson.
