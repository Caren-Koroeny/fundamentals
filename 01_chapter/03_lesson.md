#Text Editors and Browsers

During your admissions assessment, you did your programming in Dash and CodePen. Those applications ask you to write code using a web-based text editor. In other words, they ask you to write your code within your web browser.

During Fundamentals, you'll use another the web text editor called JS Bin for your exercises, but for your unit assignments, you'll need to write your code in a stand-alone text editor.

Text editors and web browsers are the tools we'll use to build web applications in class and - more importantly - on the job. Watch the video below to learn about these two essential web development tools: text editors and web browsers.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/cas8lb36dt?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>

### Sublime Text 3

Sublime Text is our editor of choice for WDI Fundamentals. Check out the following video to learn how to download, install, and use Sublime Text 3! You'll need it (or another editor like it) in order to build your Memory Game assignment.

<div class="wistia_responsive_padding" style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><div class="wistia_responsive_wrapper" style="height:100%;left:0;position:absolute;top:0;width:100%;"><iframe src="//fast.wistia.net/embed/iframe/weu4rtct39?seo=false&videoFoam=true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="wistia_embed" name="wistia_embed" allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen width="100%" height="100%"></iframe></div></div>
<script src="//fast.wistia.net/assets/external/E-v1.js" async></script>

**Resources**:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) — Our preferred Text Editor for creating HTML and CSS files.
* [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) — Our preferred web browser, used to demonstrate code rendering throughout the course.
