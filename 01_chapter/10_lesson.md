##Think Like a Programmer

Before you set out to write a program it's important to understand how computers "think." Computers solve problems differently than you or I might. They do not learn to perform tasks but need detailed, step-by-step instructions every time they perform a task.

The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it.

If you're having friends over for dinner and would like to cook up a new dish, you'll most likely find an interesting recipe and follow the instructions step-by-step in order to make something you've never made before with very predictable — and hopefully delicious — results.

Similarly, a *program* is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

*Programming* is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.


## Pseudo Code

When we write a program, we need to figure out a way to translate the ideas that are in our heads into code. 

*Pseudo code* is a way to "plan out" your program before coding it. It is a detailed description of what a computer must do, expressed in plain English rather than in a programming language.
