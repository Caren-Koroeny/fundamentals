This is Part 2 of the ELK Design! We'll be becoming more familiar with positing elements and images

### Instructions

Floats pull whatever element they're applied to out of the normal document flow. They're your secret weapon for positioning HTML elements on a page!

Here's the editor you should use to write your code:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/webuzu/embed?html,css">ELK Web Design on jsbin.com</a><script src="http://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.35.11"></script>


1 . Set your div's font-size to 1.2em, and tell it to only stretch across 50% of the screen's width.

2 .Tell both divs to display as inline-block elements.

3 . Create CSS rules for #about and #services.

4 . Give #about a float of left.

5 . Give #services a float of right.

At this point, you'll notice that some things are not so awesome here.
* The two columns are smushed together.
* The footer is behaving oddly.
