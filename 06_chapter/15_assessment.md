**WDI Fundamentals Unit 6**

---

*We'll take a break from Memory Game and practice using the terminal! The terminal will help us navigate our file and then learn how to push our code to the cloud using a command line tool called Git.*

##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

Close and restart your Terminal application.

1. In your command line, navigate to your home directory

2. Print your working directory to confirm your location

3. List the contents of the `Americas` folder without changing your working directory (HINT: use an absolute path)

4. In your home directory, create a new folder called "wdi-fundamentals"

5. Change the name of the "wdi-fundamentals" folder to "fundamentals".  Do not change its location.

6. We'll be using this folder to house your Fundamentals project, so keep it clean and don't delete it.
