##![Your Turn](../assets/exercise.png) Your Turn

In this unit you'll be building a contact book. We'll start out fairly simply and add complexity in the next couple of exercises. By the end of the unit we'll have a contact book that will allow us to store contact information, list out contacts, and find a contact by first or last name.

Instructions

1. Open a new session in [repl.it](https://repl.it/).
2. Write the code to perform the actions listed below, using repl.it's editor window.
3. Click 'play' to run the code.
4. Call each function from the console window. Try using different parameters to make sure they're working properly.

### Let's get started!

* Create an array `contacts`. This array should contain the names "Matt Smith", "Sam Davis", and "Ashley Jones"
* Create a function `findContact`, which accepts one parameter, `index`. It should return the contact at that `index`.
* Create a function `addContact`, which accepts one parameter, `name`. It should add that name to the end of the contacts array and return the contacts array.
* Create a function `updateLastContact`, which accepts one parameter, `newName`. It should update the last contact in the contacts array with the `newName` and return the contacts array.

Once you're satisfied with the way things are working, feel free to move on to the next lesson.
